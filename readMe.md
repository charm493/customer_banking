# Customer Banking System

## Overview

This project is a simple customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. Users can input their account balances, interest rates, and term lengths to see how much interest they will earn and view their updated balances over a specified number of months.

## Project Structure

The project includes four main files:

1. **Accounts.py** - Contains the `Account` class, which provides methods to set the balance and interest for both account types.

2. **savings_account.py** - Implements the `create_savings_account` function to calculate interest on savings accounts and update balances.

3. **cd_account.py** - Implements the `create_cd_account` function to calculate interest on CD accounts and update balances.

4. **customer_banking.py** - The main script that handles user interaction, including prompts for account information and displaying the results.
